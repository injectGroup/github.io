                another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from
                an online

                Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among
                other things,

                If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash
                player to block
                Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the <a

                that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the
                Macromedia site), how
                to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
